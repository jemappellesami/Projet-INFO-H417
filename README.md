All the benchmark scripts and queries are located in the "benchmark*" folders.
To perform a benchmark, one has to execute `benchmark_scripts/benchmark.sh` script.
Before, it may be preferable to change the directory in the python script by putting the path to the local git directory `+/benchmark_scripts.py`.
